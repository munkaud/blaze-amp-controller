# companion-module-bluesound-b100

If you are using this plugin as a 0. version, I'm not done building yet. This is an experiment in VSCode, Companion and making a custom module, for my own education. You have been warned.

| Version | Notes| 
| ---------- | -----------------------------------|
| **V0.0.1** | Borrowed the generic module from Bitfocus at https://github.com/bitfocus/companion-module-generic-tcp-udp/releases/tag/v2.1.3. Just getting started making changes, and re-working the module to control Bluesound B100 Streamer. I've always thought about building my own companion module - and well - here goes.|
| **V0.2.0** | Deleted entire generic tcp structure and started from scratch. There were piles of errors in the code that I did not know how to trace, so I kept the files themselves, but blanked out the code. From there I got my first preset button built and tested that, then added a couple more preset buttons, and now it is off to the races, I hope.
